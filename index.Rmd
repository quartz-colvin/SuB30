# Introduction

- In this paper, I show that Hmong *cov* is a plural classifier that generates a set of subsets (a **cover**). 

- Classifiers in White Hmong (Hmong-Mien) typically give rise to definite readings via an ι operator in the absence of an indefinite article. 

- The plural, group classifier *cov* generates a cover that can be seen clearly in definite and indefinite contexts.

---

# Introduction

### Research questions for broader project

1. What are the individual meanings of *ib*, *tus*, and *cov*?

  - ***ib***: indefinite article
  
  - ***tus***: general singular classifier
  
  - ***cov***: general plural classifier 
  
2. How do the indefinite article *ib* and the classifiers *tus* and *cov* combine to give us the correct meanings for each possible DP configuration in Hmong?

--

**Investigating this made me realize that Hmong's plural classifier is really interesting...**

--

(So is the indefinite article, but that's not the focus for today!)

### Morphosyntax

- strict SVO word order

- no case or grammatical gender distinction 

- singular, dual, and plural pronouns 

- adjectives and demonstratives come after the noun

- serial verb constructions (2+ verbs allowed in one clause)

---

# Hmong background

### Semantics

- an aspect language rather than tense

- tense is often conveyed with temporal adverbs

- no definite article

- bare classifier phrases are definite 

- bare nouns are only grammatical as kinds

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> tiger intensifier REDUP fear 

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> *"Tigers are dangerous."*

# Hmong background

### Phonology 

- monosyllabic CV words (no consonant codas!)

- prenasalized consonants 

- lateral released consonants 

- aspirated consonants

- nasalized vowels 

---

# Hmong background

### Romanized Popular Alphabet (RPA)

- in RPA the final letter of the word corresponds to a tone

- 7 tones
  - high rising (***-b***) 
  - high falling (***-j***)
  - mid (***unmarked***)
  - low (***-s***)
  - mid-rising (***-v***)
  - low-falling creaky (***-m***)
  - high-falling breathy (***-g***)

~4.5 million speakers

Diaspora communities in the US speak White and Green Hmong and are mainly from Laos, Thailand or Vietnam

# Hmong background

### The consultants

- All data and discussion are based on elicitation on Zoom with **Ying** and in person with **Keng**, two (sibling!) White Hmong speakers who were raised in Wisconsin (WI). 

--

- **Keng:** White Hmong, English, high school German 

- **Ying:** White Hmong, English, high school Japanese 

--

- Keng was born in WI and Ying immigrated to the US from Laos at age 4.

- neither speaker can read/write Hmong

# Literature

# Literature 

## Hmong-specific

- there is minimal semantic work on Hmong and previous discussion of classifiers is brief, descriptive, and focused on classifier choice (Bisang 1993)

- some work on bare classifier phrases in Hmong being definite (Simpson 2008; Simpson 2011; Simpson et. al 2015)

--

- **that's about it!**

# Proposal 

- The two DP structures with ***cov***...

knitr::include_graphics("./images/cov_aub_tree.png")
```

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width="90%", out.height="90%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/ib_cov_aub_tree.png")
```
]

---

# Proposal 

- Recall bare N is type *e*

- So, the lexical contribution of *cov* is to convert a type *e* bare noun (a kind) into a property *e,t* (Chierchia 1998) and generate a **cover**

  - A **cover**  generates a set of subsets of entities that fit the noun’s descriptive content in the context

---

# Proposal 

### Formal definition

(6) **Cov** *covers* A if: (Schwarzschild 1996)

  - **Cov** is a set of subsets of A
  
  - Every member of A belongs to some set in **Cov**
  
  - ∅ is not in **Cov**
  
  - **Cov***(A) = ℘(A), without ∅*

--

(7) [[*cups*]]<sup>*M,g*</sup> = 

  - { {c1 ⊕ c2 ⊕ c3 },

  - {c1 ⊕ c2 }, {c1 ⊕ c3 }, {c2 ⊕ c3 },

  - {c1}, {c2}, {c3} }
  
  - *cups = ℘(cup), without ∅*
  
---

# Proposal

- *cov* generates a cover of things in the relevant situation context that are of the property P.

(8) [[*cov*]]<sup>*M,g*</sup> = λP.λx.x ∈ **Cov**(P)

--

- this *cov* doesn’t operate over kinds and instead operates over properties

- assume there is an up operator (following Chierchia 1998) coupled with the *cov* denotation to show that *P* must be a property by the time *cov* combines with the noun, though this operator is not explicitly shown in my denotations

--

- now at the ClfP level of the structures, we have a property type (*e,t*)

---

# Proposal 

### The determiners: iota

- there are two relevant D options: ι, which gives a definite reading, and *ib*, which gives a very non-specific indefinite reading.

- I adopt the following formulation of ι (Jenks 2018)

(9) [[ι]] = λP : ∃!x[P(x)].ιx[P(x)]

---

# Proposal

### A determiner: *ib*

-  For the indefinite article *ib*, I analyze it as a choice function indefinite (Winter 1997) rather than an existential quantifier.

(10) [[*ib*]]<sup>*M,g*</sup> = λP. *f*<sub>*cf*</sub> (λy.P(y) = 1)

--

- A choice functional definition for *ib* more clearly explains the fact that Hmong indefinite *ib cov* DPs have a non-specific meaning and they select a random subset from the powerset generated by *cov*. 

- *ib* has a primary function of choosing a subset from the set of options in the context


--

- Once the DP structures are built via standard functional application, we see ***antipresupposition***

---

# Proposal

### Antipresupposition

- Antipresupposition must be visible at the DP level since it takes the semantics of the determiner (iota or *ib*) into account 

--

- In the case of *ib cov aub*, the choice function does not select the largest entity; otherwise, the definite ι operator would be the determiner chosen for the utterance instead of *ib*

- The choice function also does not select an atomic entity; otherwise, the singular classifier *tus* would have been chosen instead of *cov*

--

- This antipresupposition yields the non-singular and non-maximal entities as the pragmatically sound options when *ib cov aub* is uttered

---

# Contexts

(11) *AUB*<sub>*C*</sub>: \{Apollo,Mars,Copper\}

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> (a.) *tus aub* = A

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> (b.) *ib tus aub* = A or M or C

(12) *AUB*<sub>*C*</sub>: \{Apollo,Mars,Copper\}

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> (a.) *cov aub* = AMC 

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> (b.) *ib cov aub* = AMC or AM or AC or CM or A or M or C

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> (c.) *ib cov aub* = AM or AC or CM (**via antipresupposition!**)

---

# Formal derivations 

***insert later???***

---

# Discussion & Implications 


- **First,** the only defining characteristic of a classifier in Hmong (and likely other Chinese-type languages) is to convert a kind into a property. 

  - I have not applied this analysis to any languages with optional classifiers.

--

- **Second,** we expect plural classifiers in any language to have this cover property, *so long as* the classifier is the sole morphological contributor to the plurality of the noun phrase.

---

# Discussion & Implications

- This is an interesting prediction for **Mandarin**, which has also been said to have a plural classifier ***xie*** (Wu 2019). 

- It’s not clear without more thorough investigation whether indefinite ***xie*** phrases are compatible with this Hmong analysis because we would first need to establish:

  - that the word for 'one’ ***yi*** is a choice function indefinite 
  
  - that ***xie*** is a plural classifier



---

# Conclusion 

- My analysis is unique in that it explains definiteness facts as well as the number facts of definite and indefinite uses of *cov*.

--

- This may extend to other classifier languages with a general plural classifier!
