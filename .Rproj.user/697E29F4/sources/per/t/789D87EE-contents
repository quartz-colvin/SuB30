# Introduction

- In this paper, I show that Hmong *cov* is a plural classifier that generates a set of subsets (a **cover**). 

- Classifiers in White Hmong (Hmong-Mien) typically give rise to definite readings via an ι operator in the absence of an indefinite article. 

- The plural, group classifier *cov* generates a cover that can be seen clearly in definite and indefinite contexts.

--

### Research questions for broader project

1. What are the individual meanings of *ib*, *tus*, and *cov*?

2. How does the indefinite article *ib* combine with with *tus* and *cov* classifier phrases?

### Morphosyntax

- strict SVO word order

- no case or grammatical gender distinction 

- singular, dual, and plural pronouns 

- adjectives and demonstratives come after the noun

- serial verb constructions (2+ verbs allowed in one clause)

---

# Hmong background

### Semantics

- an aspect language rather than tense

- tense is often conveyed with temporal adverbs

- no definite article

- bare classifier phrases are definite 

- bare nouns are only grammatical as kinds


---

# Hmong background

### Phonology 

- monosyllabic CV words (no consonant codas!)

- prenasalized consonants 

- lateral released consonants 

- aspirated consonants

- nasalized vowels 

---

# Hmong background

### Romanized Popular Alphabet (RPA)

- in RPA the final letter of the word corresponds to a tone

- 7 tones
  - high rising (***-b***) 
  - high falling (***-j***)
  - mid (***unmarked***)
  - low (***-s***)
  - mid-rising (***-v***)
  - low-falling creaky (***-m***)
  - high-falling breathy (***-g***)

West Hmongic branch

~4.5 million speakers

Diaspora communities in the US speak White and Green Hmong and are mainly from Laos, Thailand or Vietnam

# Hmong background

### The consultants

- All data and discussion are based on elicitation on Zoom with **Ying** and in person with **Keng**, two (sibling!) White Hmong speakers who were raised in Wisconsin (WI). 

--

- **Keng:** White Hmong, English, high school German 

- **Ying:** White Hmong, English, high school Japanese 

--

- Keng was born in WI and Ying immigrated to the US from Laos at age 4.

- neither speaker can read/write Hmong

# Literature

---

# Literature 

## Hmong-specific

- there is minimal semantic work on Hmong and previous discussion of classifiers is brief, descriptive, and focused on classifier choice (Bisang 1993)

- some work on bare classifier phrases in Hmong being definite (Simpson 2008; Simpson 2011; Simpson et. al 2015)

--

- **that's about it!**

---

# Literature 

### Definiteness 

> "[Definiteness] presupposes the existence and the unicity of the noun to which it refers. In addition, it implies that the referent has been previously introduced in the discourse and that it is familiar [in the sense of (Heim 1983)] to the speaker and to the hearer." (Pozzo 2022).

---

# Literature

- in classifier languages, definiteness can sometimes be shown by classifier placement, as in Bangla (Dayal 2012).

.pull-left[
(5) boi ta 

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> book CLF

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> *"the book"*
]


.pull-right[
(6) ek ta boi 

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> one CLF book 

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> *"a book"* or *"one book"*
]

---

# Literature 

- typically classifier languages do not have a definite article, but Nuosu Yi and Indonesian are languages that may have both (Jiang 2017; Chung 2000)

(7) mu uo ma su nra jjy nra (Nuosu Yi)

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> horse three CLF DEF fat very fat 

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> *"The three horses are very fat."*

(8) itu tiga orang orang China kuli (Indonesian)

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> DEF three CLF person Chinese laborer

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> *"three of the Chinese workmen"*

---

# Literature

- bare classifier phrases are often definite, as in Vietnamese (Daley 1998)

(9) Nguoi chong rat tot 

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> CLF husband very good 

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> *"The husband was very good."*

--

- this is similar to Hmong

# Proposal

---

# Proposal 

- The lexical contribution of *cov* is to convert a type *e* bare noun (a kind) into a property (Chierchia 1998) and generate a cover

- a cover  generates a set of subsets of entities that fit the noun’s descriptive content in the context

---

# Proposal 

(10) **Cov** *covers* A if: (Schwarzschild 1996)

  - **Cov** is a set of subsets of A
  
  - Every member of A belongs to some set in **Cov**
  
  - ∅ is not in **Cov**
  
  - **Cov***(A) = ℘(A), without ∅*

--

(11) [[*cups*]]<sup>*M,g*</sup> = 

  - { {c1 ⊕ c2 ⊕ c3 },

  - {c1 ⊕ c2 }, {c1 ⊕ c3 }, {c2 ⊕ c3 },

  - {c1}, {c2}, {c3} }
  
  - *cups = ℘(cup), without ∅*
  
---

# Proposal

- *cov* generates a cover of things in the relevant situation context that are of the property P.

(12) [[*cov*]]<sup>*M,g*</sup> = λP.λx.x ∈ **Cov**(P)

- Since *cov* doesn’t operate over kinds and instead operates over properties, I assume there is an up operator (following Chierchia 1998) in the denotation to show that P must be a property by the time *cov* combines with the noun, though this operator is not explicitly shown in the following denotations.


---

# Proposal 

- As for the determiners of these DPs, there are two relevant D options: ι, which gives a definite reading, and *ib*, which gives a non-specific indefinite reading.

- I adopt the standard formulation of ι (Jenks 2018)

(13) [[ι]] = λP : ∃!x[P(x)].ιx[P(x)]

---

# Proposal

-  For the indefinite article *ib*, I analyze it as a choice function indefinite (Winter 1997) rather than an existential quantifier.

(14) [[*ib*]]<sup>*M,g*</sup> = λP. *f*<sub>*cf*</sub> (λy.P(y) = 1)

- A choice functional definition for *ib* more clearly explains the fact that Hmong indefinite *ib cov* DPs have a non-specific meaning and they select a random subset from the powerset generated by *cov*. 

- *ib* doesn’t quantify over anything in this implementation; it solely chooses a subset from the set of options.

# Proposal 

.pull-left[
```{r, out.width="80%", out.height="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/cov_aub_tree.png")

.pull-right[

knitr::include_graphics("./images/ib_cov_aub_tree.png")
```
]

- Once the DP structure is built via standard functional application, we see a case of antipresupposition

---

# Proposal

- Antipresupposition is visible at the DP level since it takes the semantics of the D head into account. 

- In the case of *ib cov aub*, the choice function does not select the largest entity; otherwise, the definite ι operator would be the determiner chosen for the utterance instead of *ib*. 

- The choice function also does not select an atomic entity; otherwise, the singular classifier *tus* would have been chosen instead of *cov*. 

- This antipresupposition yields the non-singular and non-maximal entities as the pragmatically sound options when *ib cov aub* is uttered.

# Contexts

(15) *AUB*<sub>*C*</sub>: \{Apollo,Mars,Copper\}

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> (a.) *tus aub* = A

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> (b.) *ib tus aub* = A or M or C

(16) *AUB*<sub>*C*</sub>: \{Apollo,Mars,Copper\}

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> (a.) *cov aub* = AMC 

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> (b.) *ib cov aub* = AMC or AM or AC or CM or A or M or C

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> (c.) *ib cov aub* = AM or AC or CM (**via antipresupposition!**)

# Formal derivations

# Discussion & Implications 

- Some theoretical implications of this work are as follows. 

- First, the only defining characteristic of a classifier in Hmong (and likely other Chinese-type languages) is to convert a kind into a property. I have not applied this analysis to any languages with optional classifiers.

--

- Second, we expect plural classifiers in any language to have this cover property, so long as the classifier is the sole morphological contributor to the plural meaning of the noun phrase.

--

- This is an interesting prediction for Mandarin, which has also been said to have a plural classifier *xie* (Wu 2019). 

- It’s not clear without more thorough investigation whether indefinite *xie* phrases are compatible with this because we would first need to establish that the word for 'one’ *yi* is a choice function indefinite and solidify the claim that *xie* is a plural classifier.



---

# Conclusion 

- My analysis is unique in that it explains definiteness facts as well as the number facts of definite and indefinite uses of *cov*.
