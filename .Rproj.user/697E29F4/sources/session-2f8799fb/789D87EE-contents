# Introduction

- In this presentation, I show that Hmong *cov* is a plural classifier that generates a set of subsets (a **cover**). 

--

- Classifiers in White Hmong (Hmong-Mien) typically give rise to definite readings via a null ι determiner in the absence of an indefinite article. 

---

# Introduction

### Research questions for broader project

1. What are the individual meanings of *ib*, *tus*, and *cov*?

  - ***ib***: indefinite article
  
  - ***tus***: general singular classifier
  
  - ***cov***: general plural classifier 
  
--

2. How do the indefinite article *ib* and the classifiers *tus* and *cov* combine to give us the correct meanings for the possible DP configurations in Hmong?

--

**Investigating this made me realize that Hmong's plural classifier is really interesting...**

--

(So is the indefinite article, but that's not the focus for today!)

### Phonology 

- monosyllabic CV words **(no consonant codas!)**

--

### Romanized Popular Alphabet (RPA)

- the final letter of the written word corresponds to a ***tone***!

--

- White Hmong has 7 tones:
  - high rising (***-b***) 
  - high falling (***-j***)
  - mid (***unmarked***)
  - low (***-s***)
  - mid-rising (***-v***)
  - low-falling creaky (***-m***)
  - high-falling breathy (***-g***)

# Hmong background

### The consultants

- All data and discussion are based on elicitation on Zoom with **Ying** (35) and in person with **Keng** (25), two (sibling!) White Hmong speakers who were raised in Wisconsin (WI). 

  - neither speaker can read or write Hmong, and education was in English

--

- **Keng:** White Hmong, English, high school German 

- **Ying:** White Hmong, English, high school Japanese 

--

- Keng was born in WI and Ying immigrated to the US from Laos at age 4

--

- One parent is Green Hmong heritage, but both parents speak White Hmong primarily

# Literature

---

# Literature 

## Hmong-specific

- there is minimal semantic work on Hmong and previous discussion of classifiers is brief, descriptive, and focused on classifier choice (Bisang 1993)

- some work on bare classifier phrases in Hmong being definite (Simpson 2008; Simpson 2011; Simpson et. al 2015)

  - note that this is mainly syntactic work

--

- **that's about it!**

---

# Literature 

## Mereology (Link 1983)

***Note:*** this paper is about collective predication.

Lattice structures are inherent in **mereological predicate logic**

  - particularly, they are join-semilattices (*discussed on next slide*)

--

**Mereology:** the study of parthood

- The operator **⊕ ** allows us to put individuals together to form "collections" and their formal object is called a SUM

- a SUM is an **individual, not a set**
  
  - another word for a SUM is a fusion

---

# Literature 

## Mereology (Link 1983)

**Join-semilattice:** is a partially ordered set in which all pairs have a join

- the **join** of a subset *S* of a partially ordered set *P* is the **supremum** of *S* (*V S*)

- (*a*) and (*b*) are join-semilattices but (*c*) is not (visual is from [this paper](https://math.hawaii.edu/~jb/math618/os2uh_17.pdf))

```{r, out.width="90%", out.height="90%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/lattice_examples.png")
```

---

# Literature 

### Supremum

- **supremum:** the smallest number that is greater than or equal to every element in the set
  
  - it *doesn't* need to be an element of the set
  
  - it always exists for a set that is bounded above and is unique when it exists

---

# Literature 

## Mereology (linguistic example)

.pull-left[

- this is an example of a mereological structure with three atomic entities (*m, l, and p*)

- we can see it's a join-semilattice!

- keep this mereological structure in mind

- *the details of certain types of lattices will be mostly irrelevant to understanding the rest of the talk*

```
]

---

# Proposal 

- Recall bare N is type *e*

- We can say the lexical contribution of *cov* is to convert a type *e* bare noun (a kind) into a property *e,t* (Chierchia 1998) and generate a **cover**

  - A **cover**  generates a set of subsets of entities that fit the noun’s descriptive content in the context

---

# Proposal 

### Formal definition (Schwarzschild 1996)

.pull-left[
(6) **Cov** *covers* A if: 

  - **Cov** is a set of subsets of A
  
  - Every member of A belongs to some set in **Cov**
  
  - ∅ is not in **Cov**
  
  - **Cov***(A) = ℘(A), without ∅

  - \{c1\}, \{c2\}, \{c3\}\}
  
  - *cups = ℘(cup), without ∅*
]

--

the classifier *cov* and the concept being **cov** is a coincidence...

---

# Proposal

**Returning to Hmong,**

- *cov* generates a cover of things in the relevant situation context that are of the property *P*, where *P* corresponds to the NP

(8) [[*cov*]]<sup>*M,g*</sup> = λP.λx.x ∈ **Cov**(P)

--

- compare with the singular classifier *tus*, which doesn't generate a cover

(9) [[*tus*]]<sup>*M,g*</sup> = λP.λx.[P(x) ∧ AT(x)]

--

**Classifiers in Hmong**

- *cov* doesn’t operate over kinds and instead operates over properties

- there is an "up" operator (following Chierchia 1998) coupled with the *cov* denotation to show that *P* must be a property by the time *cov* combines with the noun, though this operator is not explicitly shown in my denotations

--

- now, at the ClfP level of the structures, we have a property type (*e,t*)

---

# Proposal 

### *The* determiners: iota

- there are two relevant D options: ι, a **null determiner** which gives a definite reading, and *ib*, which gives a very non-specific indefinite reading.

- the following formulation of ι is what I use here (Jenks 2018)

(10) [[ι]] = λP : ∃!x[P(x)].ιx[P(x)]

---

# Proposal

### *A* determiner: *ib*

- the indefinite article *ib*, is primarily a choice function indefinite (Winter 1997) rather than simply an existential quantifier

(11) [[*ib*]]<sup>*M,g*</sup> = λP. *f*<sub>*cf*</sub> (λy.P(y) = 1)

--

- the choice functional analysis for *ib* more clearly explains the fact that Hmong indefinite *ib cov* DPs have a non-specific meaning and they select a random subset from the powerset generated by *cov* 

  - *ib* has a primary function of choosing a subset from the set of options in the context


--

- the DP structures are built via standard functional application, we see two micro-cases of ***antipresupposition***

---

# Proposal

### Antipresupposition

Antipresupposition ***"imposes the condition that the interlocutors not take the truth of a certain proposition for granted"*** (Percus 2006)

---

# Proposal 

### Antipresupposition 

Must be visible at the DP level since it takes the semantics of the determiner (iota or *ib*) into account 

--

***ib cov aub*** vs *iota* ***cov aub***?

- In *ib cov aub*, the choice function does not select the largest entity; otherwise, the definite (null) ι would be the determiner chosen for the utterance instead of *ib*

--

*iota* ***tus aub*** vs *iota* ***cov aub***?

- The choice function also does not select an atomic entity; otherwise, the singular classifier *tus* would have been chosen instead of *cov*

--

This antipresupposition yields the non-singular and non-maximal entities as the pragmatically sound options when *ib cov aub* is uttered

# Contexts

Instead of cups, which the mereology example in the literature review used, we'll use a context of three dogs: **Apollo, Copper** and **Mars**

.pull-left[
(12) *AUB*<sub>*C*</sub>: \{Apollo,Mars,Copper\}

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> (a.) *tus aub* = A

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> (b.) *ib tus aub* = A or M or C

- **(12a)** definite via iota
  
- **(12b)** nonspecific via choice function *ib*
]


.pull-right[

```{r, out.width="90%", out.height="80%", echo=FALSE}

# Contexts

(13) *AUB*<sub>*C*</sub>: \{Apollo,Mars,Copper\}

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> (a.) *cov aub* = AMC 

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> (b.) *ib cov aub* = AMC or AM or AC or CM or A or M or C

<span style="color:white;">(1)</span> (c.) *ib cov aub* = AM or AC or CM (**via antipresupposition!**)

--
- **(13a)** definite and maximal via iota determiner
  
- **(13b)** semantically, all entities are options 
  
- **(13c)** pragmatically, only the non-maximal and non-atomic entities are good options 

---

# Discussion & Implications 


- **First,** the only defining characteristic of a classifier in Hmong (and likely other Chinese-type languages) is to convert a kind into a property. 

  - I have not applied this analysis to any languages with optional classifiers, so I'm unsure about how much this can extend to those languages.

--

- **Second,** we expect plural classifiers in any language to have this cover property, *so long as* the classifier is the sole morphological contributor to the plurality of the noun phrase.

  - Mandarin? Maybe?

--

- **Third,** this may be able to extend to other languages with interactions between plurality and (in)definiteness

  - Persian object DPs, for example!

---

# Discussion & Implications: Mandarin

## What about Mandarin?

--

- This is an interesting prediction for **Mandarin**, which has also been said to have a plural classifier ***xie*** (Wu 2019). 

- It’s not clear without more thorough investigation whether indefinite ***xie*** phrases are compatible with this Hmong analysis because we would first need to establish:

  - that the word for 'one’ ***yi*** is a choice function indefinite 
  
  - that ***xie*** is a plural classifier

---

# Discussion & Implications: Persian

## What about Persian DOM? (Jasbi 2016)

--

Plural marking, (in)definiteness and (accusative) case interactions

- not a classifier language, so this could be a new way to look at the **cover** concept in natural language 

- certain configurations have the same **maximal** versus **nonmaximal** readings that Hmong conveyed with the choice function indefinite article and **cover** classifier!

--

**Two indefinite morphemes**

*ye* = indefinite determiner

*-i* = indefinite suffix

---

# Conclusion 

---

# Conclusion 

- My analysis is unique in that it explains definiteness facts as well as the number facts of definite and indefinite uses of *cov*.

--

- This may extend to other classifier languages with a general plural classifier!

--

- It may also extend any other language with interactions between (at least) plural morphology and (in)definiteness.
